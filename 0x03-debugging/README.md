# 0x03-debugging

This directory contains the project "Debugging". This project is a part of the low-level programming track at ALX School. It focuses on understanding the concepts of debugging, which include:

- Reading error messages
- Debugging manually
- Understanding segmentation faults
- Understanding error outputs
- Using debugging tools like gdb

In this project, we will work on improving the functionality of existing code by debugging and fixing issues. The aim is to become comfortable with the process of debugging and gain experience in common debugging practices in C programming.

Each file in this directory corresponds to a task in the project. Each task tests and builds on different aspects of debugging.
